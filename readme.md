## Author

My name is Sabrael D. Carroll (she/her), probably better known as rabbitDumpling, the internet's favorite bunny girl. I am a queer content creator—writing RPGs, recording podcasts, and streaming video games. This memex is where I am storing random notes, project references, and seeds for any potential future projects. Any questions about them, don't hesitate to contact me.
